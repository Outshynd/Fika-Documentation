## Translating

Fika is localized by the community at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/project-fika). Feel free to help us translate it into any available languages!

> [!NOTE]
> All translations are from community members, if you find any incorrect/offensive/vulgar translations, let us know

## Prerequisites

Fika requires general knowledge of computers, networking and SPT. If you are not comfortable with these concepts, this project is not for you. Please try to understand and respect this.

### Hosting

- Router and ISP that supports either **Port Forwarding** or **UPnP**
- TCP port 6969 open for the SPT Server
- UDP Port open for P2P traffic, default 25565 (if using UPnP this is not required)
- SPT installed and working, matching the version of Fika you are going to use
- Access to your Windows Firewall
- Internet speed of at least 20 Mbit/s up and down is recommended. Each client averages around 400 kbit/s.

If you can not port forward, you can use a VPN like `ZeroTier` or `Radmin` or a proxy like ``Playit.gg`` (not supported officially).

### Client

- Router and ISP that supports either **Port Forwarding** or **UPnP** | **NOTE**: This is only required if you will be hosting in-game
- UDP Port open for P2P traffic, default 25565 (if using UPnP this is not required) | **NOTE**: Same as above
- SPT installed and working, matching the version of Fika you are going to use
- Access to your Windows Firewall
- Internet speed of at least 20 Mbit/s up and down is recommended

### Both

- The latest Fika files

## Hardware Requirements

These are recommendations for a smooth experience:

- **CPU**: i7 8700k / Ryzen 7 2700x
- **GPU**: GTX 1060 / RX 580
- **Memory** 16 GB minimum, 32 GB highly recommended
- **Storage**: SSD is mandatory, do not expect support when running Fika on a HDD

These are recommendations for a dedicated client:

- **CPU**: >4 GHz per core
- **Memory**: >16 GB, 32 GB highly recommended
- **Storage**: SSD is mandatory

The biggest gain in Fika (and in SPT in general) will be getting a stronger CPU and RAM.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's crucial that you read and follow every step precisely. Skimming through or skipping any of the steps will result in the server and/or client not working. Please ensure that you know how your router works before attempting to port forward. Do not ignore the firewall steps, they are required and it's where most people fail to do it properly.

### Host using port forwarding

Before starting these steps, make sure you have port forwarded all required ports in the Prerequisites. We will not assist you with opening your ports. If do not have access to your router or can not port forward, use a VPN.

**Firewall Configuration**

1. Port forward the port 6969 **TCP** in your router (both in and out)
2. Port forward the **UDP** port that you will use in your router, default 25565 (both in and out)
3. When prompted by Windows, allow ***all*** connections in your Firewall (you can use [FikaUtils](https://github.com/Lacyway/FikaUtils/releases/download/v1.0/FikaUtils.zip) to do all this easily, extract to your installation folder)
4. If you are still having problems, we suggest you allow `EscapeFromTarkov.exe` (everyone) and `SPT.Server.exe` (server host) for inbound and outbound connections in your Windows Advanced Firewall.

**General Setup**

1. [Download the latest Fika plugin](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin/releases/latest) and [download the latest Fika server mod](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Server/releases/latest)
3. Start up the `SPT.Server.exe` once to let it generate the configuration files for Fika, then close it again
4. Go back to the main folder and navigate to `SPT_Data\Server\configs` and open `http.json`
5. Change `ip` to `0.0.0.0` and `backendIp` to your [WAN IP](https://ipv4.icanhazip.com/), then save the file and close it
6. Navigate to `user\mods\fika-server\assets\configs` and open `fika.jsonc`
7. Change any of the settings according to your likings.
    - **useBtr**: if the BTR should spawn or not when playing Streets
    - **friendlyFire**: if friendly fire should be enabled or not
    - **dynamicVExfils**: automatically scale vehicle exfils max players with the amount of players in the raid
    - **allowFreeCam**: allow players to freely toggle free cam during raids
    - **giftedItemsLoseFIR**: if sent items should lose their FiR status
8. Start the `SPT.Server.exe` and wait for it to finish loading
    - This is what it should look like if it succeeded to start with an example WAN IP of `70.60.150.90`:
    ```
    Started webserver at http://70.60.150.90:6969
    Started websocket at ws://70.60.150.90:6969
    Server is running, do not close while playing SPT, Happy playing!!
    ```
9. Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`
10. Your friends can connect to your server using your WAN IP, which can be found using the [IPv4.ICanHazIP](https://ipv4.icanhazip.com/) site

### Host using a VPN

You need a VPN like `ZeroTier` or `Radmin`. You need to allow the executables in your local Firewall (you can use [FikaUtils](https://github.com/Lacyway/FikaUtils/releases/download/v1.0/FikaUtils.zip) to do all this easily, extract to your installation folder)

1. [Download the latest Fika plugin](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin/releases/latest) and [download the latest Fika server mod](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Server/releases/latest)
2. Navigate to your SPT installation and extract the contents of the archive into the folder
3. Start up the `SPT.Server.exe` once to let it generate the configuration files for Fika, then close it again
4. Go back to the main folder and navigate to `SPT_Data\Server\configs` and open `http.json`
5. Change `ip` and `backendIp` to your VPN IP, then save the file and close it

Example with a fake address (**20.20.56.73**):
```json
{
    "ip": "20.20.56.73",
    "port": 6969,
    "backendIp": "20.20.56.73",
    "backendPort": 6969,
    "webSocketPingDelayMs": 90000,
    "logRequests": true,
    "serverImagePathOverride": {}
}
```
6. Navigate to `user\mods\fika-server\assets\configs` and open `fika.jsonc`
7. Change any of the settings according to your likings.
    - **useBtr**: if the BTR should spawn or not when playing Streets
    - **friendlyFire**: if friendly fire should be enabled or not
    - **dynamicVExfils**: automatically scale vehicle exfils max players with the amount of players in the raid
    - **allowFreeCam**: allow players to freely toggle free cam during raids
    - **giftedItemsLoseFIR**: if sent items should lose their FiR status
8. Start the `SPT.Server.exe` and wait for it to finish loading
    - This is what it should look like if it succeeded to start using the example IP in step 5:
    ```
    Started webserver at http://20.20.56.73:6969
    Started websocket at ws://20.20.56.73:6969
    Server is running, do not close while playing SPT, Happy playing!!
    ```
9. Start `SPT.Launcher.exe` and click 'Settings' and enable `Developer Mode`
10. In the `URL` field, change it to reflect your VPN IP. Using the example in step 5 it would be: `http://20.20.56.73:6969` (remember to remove any trailing forward slashes `/`)
11. Start the game, and once your account is created set both `Force IP` and `Force Bind IP` to your *own*, *personal* VPN IP. You can find these by clicking `F12` in the main menu.

### Host using Playit

> [!WARNING]
> This is not officially supported by the Fika staff, you are on your own if it doesn't work

[Playit.gg](https://playit.gg/) is a proxy that makes it possible to host servers without having to port forward,
by relaying the game traffic over one of their datacenters.
[This guide](https://discuss.playit.gg/t/setup-an-escape-from-tarkov-multiplayer-server-with-spt-fika/3352) will teach you how to use Playit.gg
to host a SPT/Fika Server.
Editing your ``http.json`` is not required.

### Dedicated Client

> [!CAUTION]
> This section is only for advanced users

1. Make sure that you have a working server and client installed (working means that you have ***ran it at least once***)
2. Copy the client to a new folder and install the latest [dedicated plugin](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Dedicated/releases)
3. On your `SPT.Server`, open the `fika.jsonc` configuration file and at the bottom change your dedicated settings
```json
"dedicated": {
        "profiles": {
            "amount": 1 // the amount of dedicated profiles to generate automatically, one per dedicated client
        },
        "scripts": {
            "generate": true, // if a startup script should be automatically generated (required unless you know what you are doing)
            "forceIp": "127.0.0.1" // the ip the dedicated client should connect to, leave at default if local
        }
    }
```
4. Start up your `SPT.Server` once to let it generate the profile and startup script, then go to `\user\mods\fika-server\assets\scripts` and find the generated script. Move this to your client installation root folder created in step 2 (if you wish to re-regenerate these scripts, you need to delete the *old dedicated profiles*)
5. Either port forward or set up your VPN as normal, and then manually change your `fika.core` configuration in `\BepInEx\config\com.fika.core.cfg`. Set the port to your forwarded port, or set bind and force IP to the dedicated client's IP.
6. Launch the dedicated client by running the batch script, then in-game when hosting on your own client, tick the "Use Dedicated" to use the dedicated client for hosting. It can only host one raid per client. It is generally recommended to put all your AI mods on the dedicated client and remove them locally on your own since the dedicated will now handle the AI instead.

After launching the dedicated once you can configure the settings in `\BepInEx\config\com.fika.dedicated.cfg` and then restart for them to apply.

### Client using port forwarding

1. [Download the latest Fika plugin](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin/releases/latest)
2. Navigate to your SPT installation and extract the contents of the archive into the folder
3. Start `SPT.Launcher.exe` and click 'Settings' and enable `Developer Mode`
4. In the `URL` field, change it to reflect the hosts WAN IP. As an example it could be: `http://70.60.150.90:6969` (remember to remove any trailing forward slashes `/`)

### Client using a VPN

1. [Download the latest Fika plugin](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Plugin/releases/latest)
2. Navigate to your SPT installation and extract the contents of the archive into the folder
3. Start `SPT.Launcher.exe` and click 'Settings' and enable `Developer Mode`
4. In the `URL` field, change it to reflect the hosts VPN IP. Using the example in step 5 it would be: `http://20.20.56.73:6969` (remember to remove any trailing forward slashes `/`)

### Host raids as a client using port forwarding

1. Port forward  `25565 UDP` in your router (or any other port you wish to use, but make sure to change the port in the `F12` menu accordingly!)
2. Make sure to allow `EscapeFromTarkov.exe` in your Windows Firewall (you can use [FikaUtils](https://github.com/Lacyway/FikaUtils/releases/download/v1.0/FikaUtils.zip) to do all this easily, extract to your installation folder)
3. You can now host in-game

### Host raids as a client using a VPN

2. Open the game and open the configuration menu with `F12`
3. Set your own, personal VPN IP in both `Force IP` and `Force Bind IP`
4. You can now host in-game

## Features and Configuration

### Features & How-To
**Fika** lets you to host P2P sessions with your friends to play COOP. The host is the one that controls most of the logic while playing, such as controlling AI, minefields, sniper zones, the BTR, etc. Each client is responsible for their own damage, both on themselves and on AI. This means that shooting an AI feels responsive and quick.

To host a game, choose a map and time, and then on the final screen click `Host Raid`. Select the amount of players that will be playing (including yourself) and wait for it to finish loading. Once it's ready other people can join your session, and when everyone has finished loading it will automatically start.

**Other Features of Fika**
- Item Sending
    - Right-click an item in your stash to send it to another account
    - Can be customized in the [server](#server-configuration) config
- Free cam (default to `F9` key)
    - In free cam you can teleport to the cam position by pressing `T`
    - You can jump to another player by `Left/Right` clicking
    - You can snap to their head by holding `SPACE` when jumping
    - You can snap to their back in a 3rd position view by holding `CTRL` when jumping
    - You can press the `HOME` key to temporarily toggle free cam controls
- Damage multipliers for crucial areas on yourself
- Dynamic AI for hosts, which disables AI when no one is near
- Custom AI limits per map
- Culling system to increase performance
- Custom notifications (teammate died, boss got killed by a player, etc.)
- Pinging system to ping an area in the game for your teammates
- Player health bars for your teammates
- Quest progress sharing in raids
- Dedicated clients

Most of these features are configured in the [client configuration](#client-configuration).

### Client Configuration

To open up your client configuration, press the `F12` key while in-game. Head to the `Fika Core` section to configure the settings.

**Coop**

- **Show Notifications**: Enable custom notifications when a player dies, extracts, kills a boss, etc.
- **Auto Extract**: Automatically extracts when playing as a client instead of entering free camera.
- **Show Extract Message**: Whether to show the extract message after dying/extracting.
- **Extract Key**: The key used to extract from the raid.
- **Chat Key**: The key used to open the chat window.

**Coop | Custom**

- **Show Player Name Plates**: Toggle Health-Bars & Names.
- **Hide Health Bar**: Completely hides the health bar.
- **Show HP% instead of bar**: Shows health in % amount instead of using the bar.
- **Show Player Faction Icon**: Shows the player faction icon next to the HP bar.
- **Hide Name Plate in Optic**: Hides the name plate when viewing through PiP scopes.
- **Name Plates Use Optic Zoom**:  name plate location should be displayed using the PiP optic camera.
- **Decrease Opacity In Peripheral**: Decreases the opacity of the name plates when not looking at a player.
- **Name Plate Scale**: Size of the name plates.
- **Opacity in ADS**: The opacity of the name plates when aiming down sights.
- **Ping System**: Toggle Ping System. If enabled you can receive and send pings by pressing the ping key.
- **Ping Button**: Button used to send pings.
- **Ping Color**: The color of your pings when displayed for other players.
- **Ping Size**: The multiplier of the ping size.
- **Play Ping Animation**: Plays the pointing animation automatically when pinging. Can interfere with gameplay.

**Coop | Quest Sharing**
- **Quest Types**: Which quest types to receive and send.

**Coop | Debug**

- **Free Camera Button**: Button used to toggle free camera.
- **AZERTY Mode**: If free camera should use AZERTY keys for input.
- **Keybind Overlay**:  an overlay with all free cam keybinds should show.

**Performance**

- **Dynamic AI**: Use the dynamic AI system, disabling AI when they are outside of any player's range.
- **Dynamic AI Range**: The range at which AI will be disabled dynamically.
- **Dynamic AI Rate**: How often DynamicAI should scan for the range from all players.

**Performance | Max Bots**

- **Enforced Spawn Limits**: Enforces spawn limits when spawning bots, making sure to not go over the vanilla limits. This mainly takes affect when using spawn mods or anything that modifies the bot limits.
- **Despawn Furthest**: When enforcing spawn limits, should the furthest bot be de-spawned instead of blocking the spawn. This will make for a much more active raid on a lower Max Bots count. Helpful for weaker PCs. Will only despawn pmcs and scavs. If you don't run a dynamic spawn mod, this will however quickly exhaust the spawns on the map, making the raid very dead instead.
- **Despawn Minimum Distance**: Don't despawn bots within this distance.
- **Max Bots** `MAP`: Max amount of bots that can be active at the same time on `MAP`. Useful if you have a weaker PC. Set to 0 to disable.

**Network**

- **Native Sockets**:  NativeSockets for gameplay traffic. This uses direct socket calls for send/receive to drastically increase speed and reduce GC pressure. Only for Windows/Linux and might not always work.
- **Force IP**: Forces the server when hosting to use this IP when broadcasting to the backend instead of automatically trying to fetch it. Leave empty to disable. This is required when using a VPN, use your personal VPN IP.
- **Force Bind IP**: Forces the server when hosting to use this local IP when starting the server. Leave empty to disable. This is required when using a VPN, use your personal VPN IP.
- **Auto Server Refresh Rate**: Every X seconds the client will ask the server for the list of matches while at the lobby screen.
- **UDP Port**: Port to use for UDP gameplay packets.
- **Use UPnP**: Attempt to open ports using UPnP. Useful if you cannot open ports yourself but the router supports UPnP.
- **Use NAT Punching**: Use NAT punching when hosting a raid. Only works with fullcone NAT type routers and requires NatPunchServer to be running on the SPT server. UPnP, Force IP and Force Bind IP are disabled with this mode.
- **Connection Timeout**: How long it takes for a connection to be considered dropped if no packets are received.

**Gameplay**

- **Head Damage Multiplier**: X multiplier to damage taken on the head collider. 0.2 = 20%
- **Armpit Damage Multiplier**: X multiplier to damage taken on the armpits collider. 0.2 = 20%
- **Stomach Damage Multiplier**: X multiplier to damage taken on the stomach collider. 0.2 = 20%
- **Disable Bot Metabolism**: Disables metabolism on bots, preventing them from dying from loss of energy/hydration during long raids.

### Server Configuration
